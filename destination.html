            <div class="separator"></div>
            <p class="desc">Rizal Boulevard is named after Dr. Jose Rizal, a man who is considered the national icon in the Philippines. In the 1880s, during Spain’s colonial rule of the Philippines, Dr. Rizal worked through non-violent action to expose many negative aspects of the Spanish rule and proposed governmental reforms to improve life for the Filipinos. Dr. Rizal was banished and eventually executed for his views on Spain’s rule of the Philippines, but his life and untimely death encouraged more Filipinos to seek independence from Spain. This is an excellent spot for anyone interested in the history of the Philippines.
